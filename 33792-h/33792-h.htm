<h3>INTRODUCTORY NOTE.</h3>



<p>Emile Verhaeren, remarkable among of the brilliant group of writers
representing "Young Belgium," and one who has been recognized by the
literary world of France as holding a foremost place among the lyric
poets of the day was born at St. Amand, near Antwerp, in 1855. His
childhood was passed on the banks of the Scheldt, in the midst of the
wide-spreading Flemish plains, a country of mist and flood, of dykes and
marshes, and the impressions he received from the mysterious, melancholy
character of these surroundings, have produced a marked and lasting
influence upon his work. Yet the other characteristics with which it is
stamped&mdash;the wealth of imagination, the gloomy force, the wonderful
descriptive power and sense of colour, which set the landscape before
one as a picture, suggest rather the possibility of Spanish blood in the
poet's veins&mdash;and again, his somewhat morbid subjectivity and tendency
to self-analysis mark him as the child of the latter end of our
nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Verhaeren entered early in life upon the literary career. After some
time spent at a college in Ghent, he became a student at the University
of Louvain, and here he founded and edited a journal called "<i>La
Semaine</i>," in which work he was assisted by the singer Van Dyck, and by
his friend and present publisher, Edmond Deman. He also formed, about
this time, a close friendship with Maeterlinck. In 1881, Verhaeren was
called to the Bar at Brussels, but soon gave up his legal career to
devote himself entirely to literature. In 1883 he published his first
volume of poems, and shortly afterwards became one of the editors of
"<i>L'Art Moderne</i>," to which, as well as to other contemporary periodicals,
he was for many years a contributor. In 1892 he founded, with the help
of two other friends, the "Section of Art" in the "House of the People,"
a popular institution in Brussels, where performances of the best music,
as well as lectures upon literary and artistic subjects, were given. In
spite, however, of the work which all this entailed, and of the many
interests created by his ardent appreciation of the various branches of
art and literature, Verhaeren continued to labour unceasingly at his
poetical work, and between 1883 and 1897 brought out successively eleven
small volumes: <i>Les Flamandes, Les Moines, Les Soirs, Les Débâcles, Les
Flambeaux Noirs, Les Apparus dans mes chemins, Les Campagnes
Hallucinées, Les Villages Illusoires, Les Villes Tentaculaires, Les
Heures Claires,</i> and <i>Les Aubes</i>.</p>

<p>Throughout this entire series the intellectual and spiritual development
of the poet may be closely traced&mdash;from the materialism which pervades
<i>Les Flamandes</i>, and the despairing pessimism and lurid emotion&mdash;the
throes of a self-centred soul in revolt against fate&mdash;which are so
powerfully portrayed in <i>Les Débâcles</i> and <i>Les Flambeaux Noirs</i>, and are
apparent even in the opening pages of <i>Les Apparus</i> dans mes chemins&mdash;to
the tender, hopeful mysticism which marks the latter poems in that
volume, and the wonderful sympathy with Nature, even in her saddest
aspects&mdash;the subtle power of endowing those aspects with a profound and
ennobling symbolism, which characterise the most beautiful of the poems
in Les Villages Illusoires. Les Heures Claires is the name given to a
volume of love-songs, an exquisite record of golden hours spent in a
garden at spring-time&mdash;spring-time in a double sense.</p>

<p>The task of making an adequate and typical selection from a poet's work
is always difficult, and in this case it has been decided to limit the
field of selection, at least for the present, to the three last-named
volumes, which embody what may, I think, be considered as Verhaeren's
highest achievement in the realm of lyrical poetry.</p>


<p>In style, Verhaeren is essentially the apostle of the "Vers libre"; and
his handling of rhyme and rhythm, his coining of words where he finds
the French vocabulary insufficient, have called down upon him some
criticism from those of his French contemporaries who are sticklers for
the older rules and more conventional forms of versification. But
however this may be, it remains an undeniable fact that Verhaeren has at
his command a rare and powerful poetic eloquence&mdash;a wealth of imagery, a
depth of thought and a subtlety of expression which perhaps are not to
be imprisoned behind the bars of a too rigid convention. English readers
have already been accustomed by their own poets to the "vers libre," and
it is not so much, therefore, for my adherence to this form, as for my
failure adequately to render Verhaeren's peculiar and striking beauty of
language, that I beg their indulgence for the following translations.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><b><a name="RAIN" id="RAIN"></a>RAIN</b></span><br />
<br />
<br />
Long as unending threads, the long-drawn rain<br />
Interminably, with its nails of grey,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Athwart the dull grey day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Rakes the green window-pane&mdash;</span><br />
So infinitely, endlessly, the rain,<br />
The long, long rain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">The rain.</span><br />
<br />
Since yesternight it keeps unravelling<br />
Down from the frayed and flaccid rags that cling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">About the sullen sky.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The low black sky;</span><br />
Since yesternight, so slowly, patiently.<br />
Unravelling its threads upon the roads.<br />
Upon the roads and lanes, with even fall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Continual.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Along the miles<br />
That 'twixt the meadows and the suburbs lie,<br />
By roads interminably bent, the files<br />
Of waggons, with their awnings arched and tall.<br />
Struggling in sweat and steam, toil slowly by<br />
With outline vague as of a funeral.<br />
Into the ruts, unbroken, regular,<br />
Stretching out parallel so far<br />
That when night comes they seem to join the sky.<br />
For hours the water drips;<br />
And every tree and every dwelling weeps.<br />
Drenched as they are with it.<br />
With the long rain, tenaciously, with rain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Indefinite.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
The rivers, through each rotten dyke that yields.<br />
Discharge their swollen wave upon the fields.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Where coils of drownèd hay</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Float far away;</span><br />
And the wild breeze<br />
Buffets the alders and the walnut-trees;<br />
Knee-deep in water great black oxen stand,<br />
Lifting their bellowings sinister on high<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">To the distorted sky;</span><br />
As now the night creeps onward, all the land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Thicket and plain,</span><br />
Grows cumbered with her clinging shades immense.<br />
And still there is the rain,<br />
The long, long rain.<br />
Like soot, so fine and dense.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">The long, long rain.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Rain&mdash;and its threads identical,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">And its nails systematical,</span><br />
Weaving the garment, mesh by mesh amain,<br />
Of destitution for each house and wall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">And fences that enfold</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">The villages, neglected, grey, and old:</span><br />
Chaplets of rags and linen shreds that fall<br />
In frayed-out wisps from upright poles and tall.<br />
Blue pigeon-houses glued against the thatch,<br />
And windows with a patch<br />
Of dingy paper on each lowering pane,<br />
Houses with straight-set gutters, side by side<br />
Across the broad stone gambles crucified,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Mills, uniform, forlorn.</span><br />
Each rising from its hillock like a horn,<br />
Steeples afar and chapels round about,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The rain, the long, long rain,</span><br />
Through all the winter wears and wears them out.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Rain, with its many wrinkles, the long rain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">With its grey nails, and with its watery mane;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The long rain of these lands of long ago,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The rain, eternal in its torpid flow!</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><b><a name="THE_FERRYMAN" id="THE_FERRYMAN"></a>THE FERRYMAN</b></span><br />
<br />
<br />
The ferryman, a green reed 'twixt his teeth,<br />
With hand on oar, against the current strong<br />
Had rowed and rowed so long.<br />
<br />
<br />
But she, alas! whose voice was hailing him<br />
Across the far waves dim.<br />
Still further o'er the far waves seemed to float,<br />
Still further backwards, 'mid the mists, remote.<br />
<br />
<br />
The casements with their eyes.<br />
The dial-faces of the towers that rise<br />
Upon the shore,<br />
Watched, as he strove and laboured more and more.<br />
With frantic bending of the back in two,<br />
And start of savage muscles strained anew.<br />
<br />
<br />
One oar was suddenly riven,<br />
And by the current driven,<br />
With lash of heavy breakers, out to sea.<br />
<br />
<br />
But she, whose voice that hailed him he could hear<br />
There 'mid the mist and wind, she seemed to wring<br />
Her hands with gestures yet more maddening<br />
Toward him who drew not near.<br />
<br />
<br />
The ferryman with his surviving oar<br />
Fell harder yet to work, and more and more<br />
He strove, till every joint did crack and start,<br />
And fevered terror shook his very heart.<br />
<br />
<br />
The rudder broke<br />
Beneath one sharp, rude stroke;<br />
That, too, the current drove relentlessly,<br />
A dreary shred of wreckage, out to sea.<br />
<br />
<br />
The casements by the pier,<br />
Like eyes immense and feverish open wide,<br />
The dials of the towers&mdash;those widows drear<br />
Upstanding straight from mile to mile beside<br />
The banks of rivers&mdash;obstinately gaze<br />
Upon this madman, in his headstrong craze<br />
Prolonging his mad voyage 'gainst the tide.<br />
<br />
<br />
But she, who yonder in the mist-clouds hailed<br />
Him still so desperately, she wailed and wailed,<br />
With head outstretched in fearful, straining haste<br />
Toward the unknown of the outstretched waste.<br />
<br />
<br />
Steady as one that had in bronze been cast,<br />
Amid the blenched, grey tempest and the blast.<br />
The ferryman his single oar yet plied.<br />
And, spite of all, still lashed and bit the tide.<br />
His old eyes, with hallucinated gaze,<br />
Saw that far distance&mdash;an illumined haze&mdash;<br />
Whence the voice sounded, coming toward him still.<br />
Beneath the cold skies, lamentable, shrill.<br />
<br />
<br />
The last oar broke&mdash;<br />
And this the current hurried at one stroke,<br />
Like a frail straw, towards the distant sea.<br />
<br />
<br />
The ferryman, with arms dropped helplessly<br />
Sank on his bench, forlorn.<br />
His loins with vain efforts broken, torn.<br />
<br />
<br />
Drifting, his barque struck somewhere, as by chance,<br />
He turned a glance<br />
Towards the bank behind him then&mdash;and saw<br />
He had not left the shore.<br />
<br />
<br />
The casements and the dials, one by one.<br />
Their huge eyes gazing in a foolish stare.<br />
Witnessed the ruin of his ardour there;<br />
But still the old, tenacious ferryman<br />
Firm in his teeth&mdash;for God knows when, indeed&mdash;<br />
Held the green reed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><b><a name="THE_SILENCE" id="THE_SILENCE"></a>THE SILENCE</b></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ever since ending of the summer weather.<br />
When last the thunder and the lightning broke,<br />
Shatt'ring themselves upon it at one stroke,<br />
The Silence has not stirred, there in the heather.<br />
<br />
<br />
All round about stand steeples straight as stakes,<br />
And each its bell between its fingers shakes;<br />
All round about, with their three-storied loads,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The teams prowl down the roads;</span><br />
All round about, where'er the pine woods end,<br />
The wheel creaks on along its rutty bed,<br />
But not a sound is strong enough to rend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">That space intense and dead.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Since summer, thunder-laden, last was heard.<br />
The Silence has not stirred;<br />
And the broad heath-land, where the nights sink down<br />
Beyond the sand-hills brown.<br />
Beyond the endless thickets closely set,<br />
To the far borders of the far-away.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Prolongs It yet.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Even the winds disturb not as they go<br />
The boughs of those long larches, bending low<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Where the marsh-water lies,</span><br />
In which Its vacant eyes<br />
Gaze at themselves unceasing, stubbornly.<br />
Only sometimes, as on their way they move,<br />
The noiseless shadows of the clouds above.<br />
Or of some great bird's hov'ring flight on high,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Brush It in passing by.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Since the last bolt that scored the earth aslant,<br />
Nothing has pierced the Silence dominant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of those who cross Its vast immensity,<br />
Whether at twilight or at dawn it be,<br />
There is not one but feels<br />
The dread of the Unknown that It instils;<br />
An ample force supreme, It holds Its sway<br />
Uninterruptedly the same for aye.<br />
Dark walls of blackest fir-trees bar from sight<br />
The outlook towards the paths of hope and light;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Huge, pensive junipers</span><br />
Affright from far the passing travellers;<br />
Long, narrow paths stretch their straight lines unbent.<br />
Till they fork off in curves malevolent;<br />
And the sun, ever shifting, ceaseless lends<br />
Fresh aspects to the mirage whither tends<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Bewilderment</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Since the last bolt was forged amid the storm,<br />
The polar Silence at the corners four<br />
Of the wide heather-land has stirred no more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Old shepherds, whom their hundred years have worn<br />
To things all dislocate and out of gear,<br />
And their old dogs, ragged, tired-out, and torn.<br />
Oft watch It, on the soundless lowlands near,<br />
Or downs of gold beflecked with shadows' flight,<br />
Sit down immensely there beside the night.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then, at the curves and corners of the mere.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The waters creep with fear;</span><br />
The heather veils itself, grows wan and white;<br />
All the leaves listen upon all the bushes,<br />
And the incendiary sunset hushes<br />
Before Its face his cries of brandished light.<br />
And in the hamlets that about It lie.<br />
Beneath the thatches of their hovels small<br />
The terror dwells of feeling It is nigh.<br />
And, though It stirs not, dominating all.<br />
Broken with dull despair and helplessness,<br />
Beneath Its presence they crouch motionless,<br />
As though upon the watch&mdash;and dread to see.<br />
Through rifts of vapour, open suddenly<br />
At evening, in the moon, the argent eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Of Its mute mysteries.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><b><a name="THE_BELL-RINGER" id="THE_BELL-RINGER"></a>THE BELL-RINGER</b></span><br />
<br />
<br />
Yon, in the depths of the evening's track,<br />
Like a herd of blind bullocks that seek their fellows,<br />
Wild, as in terror, the tempest bellows.<br />
And suddenly, there, o'er the gables black<br />
That the church, in the twilight, around it raises<br />
All scored with lightnings the steeple blazes.<br />
<br />
<br />
See the old bell-ringer, frenzied with fear.<br />
Mouth gaping, yet speechless, draw hastening near.<br />
And the knell of alarm that with strokes of lead<br />
He rings, heaves forth in a tempest of dread<br />
The frantic despair that throbs in his head.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the cross at the height<br />
Of its summit brandished, the lofty steeple<br />
Spreads the crimson mane<br />
Of the fire o'er the plain<br />
Toward the dream-like horizons that bound the night;<br />
The city nocturnal is filled with light;<br />
The face of the swift-gathered crowds doth people<br />
With fears and with clamours both street and lane;<br />
On walls turned suddenly dazzling bright<br />
The dusky panes drink the crimson flood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Like draughts of blood.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Yet, knell upon knell, the old ringer doth cast<br />
His frenzy and fear o'er the country vast.<br />
<br />
<br />
The steeple, it seems to be growing higher<br />
Against the horizon that shifts and quivers,<br />
And to be flying in gleams of fire<br />
Far o'er the lakes and the swampy rivers.<br />
Its slates, like wings<br />
Of sparks and spangles, afar it flings.<br />
They fly toward the forests across the night:<br />
And in their passage the fires exhume<br />
The hovels and huts from their folds of gloom,<br />
Setting them suddenly all alight.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the crashing fall of the steeple's crown<br />
The cross to the brazier's depth drops down,<br />
Where, twisted and torn in the fiery fray,<br />
Its Christian arms are crushed like prey.<br />
With might and main<br />
The bell-ringer sounds his knell abroad.<br />
As though the flames would burn his God.<br />
<br />
<br />
The fire<br />
Funnel-like hollows its way yet higher,<br />
'Twixt walls of stone, up the steeple's height;<br />
Gaining the archway and lofty stage<br />
Where, swinging in light, the bell bounds with rage.<br />
The daws and the owls, with wild, long cry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Pass screeching by;</span><br />
On the fast-closed casements their heads they smite,<br />
Burn in the smoke-drifts their pinions light,<br />
Then, broken with terror and bruised with flight.<br />
Suddenly, 'mid the surging crowd.<br />
Fall dead outright.<br />
<br />
<br />
The old man sees toward his brandished bells<br />
The climbing fire<br />
With hands of boiling gold stretch nigher.<br />
<br />
<br />
The steeple<br />
Looks like a thicket of crimson bushes,<br />
With here a branch of flame that rushes<br />
Darting the belfry boards between;<br />
Convulsed and savage flames, they cling,<br />
With curves that plant-like curl and lean.<br />
Round every joist, round every pulley,<br />
And monumental beams, whence ring<br />
The bells, that voice forth frenzied folly.<br />
<br />
<br />
His fear and anguish spent, the ringer<br />
Sounds his own knell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">On his ruined bell.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
A final crash,<br />
All dust and plaster in one grey flash,<br />
Cleaves the whole steeple's height in pieces;<br />
And like some great cry slain, it ceases<br />
All on a sudden, the knell's dull rage.<br />
The ancient tower<br />
Seems sudden to lean and darkly lower;<br />
While with heavy thuds, as from stage to stage<br />
They headlong bound.<br />
The bells are heard<br />
Plunging and crashing towards the ground.<br />
<br />
<br />
But yet the old ringer has never stirred.<br />
And, scooping the moist earth out, the bell<br />
Was thus his coffin, and grave as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><b><a name="THE_SNOW" id="THE_SNOW"></a>THE SNOW</b></span><br />
<br />
<br />
Uninterruptedly falls the snow,<br />
Like meagre, long wool-strands, scant and slow,<br />
O'er the meagre, long plain disconsolate.<br />
Cold with lovelessness, warm with hate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Infinite, infinite falls the snow.<br />
Like a moment's time.<br />
Monotonously, in a moment's time;<br />
On the houses it falls and drops, the snow.<br />
Monotonous, whitening them o'er with rime;<br />
It falls on the sheds and their palings below.<br />
And myriad-wise, it falls and lies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">In ridgèd waves</span><br />
In the churchyard hollows between the graves.<br />
<br />
<br />
The apron of all inclement weather<br />
Is roughly unfastened, there on high;<br />
The apron of woes and misery<br />
Is shaken by wind-gusts violently<br />
Down on the hamlets that crouch together<br />
Beneath the dull horizon-sky.<br />
<br />
<br />
The frost creeps down to the very bones,<br />
And want creeps in through the walls and stones;<br />
Yea, snow and want round the souls creep close,<br />
&mdash;The heavy snow diaphanous&mdash;<br />
Round the stone-cold hearths and the flameless souls<br />
That wither away in their huts and holes.<br />
<br />
<br />
The hamlets bare<br />
White, white as Death lie yonder, where<br />
The crookèd roadways cross and halt;<br />
Like branching traceries of salt<br />
The trees, all crystallized with frost,<br />
Stretch forth their boughs, entwined and crost.<br />
Along the ways, as on they go<br />
In far procession o'er the snow.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then here and there, some ancient mill,<br />
Where light, pale mosses aggregate,<br />
Appears on a sudden, standing straight<br />
Like a snare upon its lonely hill.<br />
The roofs and sheds, down there below.<br />
Since November dawned, have been wrestling still,<br />
In contrary blasts, with the hurricane;<br />
While, thick and full, yet falls amain<br />
The infinite snow, with its weary weight,<br />
O'er the meagre, long plain disconsolate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus journeys the snow afar so fleet.<br />
Into every cranny, on every trail;<br />
Always the snow and its winding-sheet,<br />
The mortuary snow so pale.<br />
The snow, unfruitful and so pale.<br />
In wild and vagabond tatters hurled<br />
Through the limitless winter of the world.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
In the garden yonder of yews and death,<br />
There sojourneth<br />
A man who toils, and has toiled for aye.<br />
Digging the dried-up ground all day.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some willows, surviving their own dead selves.<br />
Weep there around him as he delves.<br />
And a few poor flowers, disconsolate<br />
Because the tempest and wind and wet<br />
Vex them with ceaseless scourge and fret.<br />
<br />
<br />
The ground is nothing but pits and cones,<br />
Deep graves in every corner yawn;<br />
The frost in the winter cracks the stones,<br />
And when the summer in June is born<br />
One hears, 'mid the silence that pants for breath,<br />
The germinating and life of Death<br />
Below, among the lifeless bones.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since ages longer than he can know,<br />
The grave-digger brings his human woe,<br />
That never wears out, and lays its head<br />
Slowly down in that earthy bed.<br />
<br />
<br />
By all the surrounding roads, each day<br />
They come towards him, the coffins white,<br />
They come in processions infinite;<br />
They come from the distances far away.<br />
From corners obscure and out-of-the-way.<br />
From the heart of the towns&mdash;and the wide-spreading<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">plain.</span><br />
The limitless plain, swallows up their track;<br />
They come with their escort of people in black.<br />
At every hour, till the day doth wane;<br />
And at early dawn the long trains forlorn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Begin again.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
The grave-digger hears far off the knell,<br />
Beneath weary skies, of the passing bell,<br />
Since ages longer than he can tell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some grief of his each coffin carrieth&mdash;<br />
His wild desires toward evenings dark with death<br />
Are here: his mournings for he knows not what:<br />
Here are his tears, for ever on this spot<br />
Motionless in their shrouds: his memories.<br />
With gaze worn-out from travelling through the years<br />
So far, to bid him call to mind the fears<br />
Of which their souls are dying&mdash;and with these<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Lies side by side</span><br />
The shattered body of his broken pride.<br />
His heroism, to which nought replied,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Is here all unavailing;</span><br />
His courage, 'neath its heavy armour failing.<br />
And his poor valour, gashed upon the brow.<br />
Silent, and crumbling in corruption now.<br />
The grave-digger watches them come into sight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">The long, slow roads.</span><br />
Marching towards him, with all their loads<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Of coffins white.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Here are his keenest thoughts, that one by one<br />
His lukewarm soul hath tainted and undone;<br />
And his white loves of simple days of yore,<br />
in lewd and tempting mirrors sullied o'er;<br />
The proud, mute vows that to himself he made<br />
Are here&mdash;for he hath scored and cancelled them,<br />
As one may cut and notch a diadem;<br />
And here, inert and prone, his will is laid,<br />
Whose gestures flashed like lightning keen before.<br />
But that he now can raise in strength no more.<br />
<br />
<br />
The grave-digger digs to the sound of the knell<br />
'Mid the yews and the deaths in yonder dell.<br />
Since ages longer than he can tell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is his dream&mdash;born in the radiant glow.<br />
Of joy and young oblivion, long ago&mdash;<br />
That in black fields of science he let go,<br />
That he hath clothed with flame and embers bright,<br />
&mdash;Red wings plucked off from Folly in her flight&mdash;<br />
That he hath launched toward inaccessible<br />
Spaces afar, toward the distance there,<br />
The golden conquest of the Impossible,<br />
And that the limitless, refractory sky,<br />
Sends back to him again, or it has ere<br />
So much as touched the immobile mystery.<br />
<br />
<br />
The grave-digger turneth it round and round&mdash;<br />
With arms by toil so weary made,<br />
With arms so thin, and strokes of spade&mdash;<br />
Since what long times?&mdash;the dried-up ground.<br />
Here, for his anguish and remorse, there throng<br />
Pardons denied to creatures in the wrong;<br />
And here, the tears, the prayers, the silent cries,<br />
He would not list to in his brothers' eyes.<br />
The insults to the gentle, and the jeer<br />
What time the humble bent their knees, are here;<br />
Gloomy denials, and a bitter store<br />
Of arid sarcasms, oft poured out before<br />
Devotedness that in the shadow stands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">With outstretched hands.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
The grave-digger, weary, yet eager as well.<br />
Hiding his pain to the sound of the knell,<br />
With strokes of the spade turns round and round<br />
The weary sods of the dried-up ground.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then&mdash;fear-struck dallyings with suicide;<br />
Delays, that conquer hours that would decide:<br />
Again&mdash;the terrors of dark crime and sin<br />
Furtively felt with frenzied fingers thin:<br />
The fierce craze and the fervent rage to be<br />
The man who lives of the extremity<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Of his own fear:</span><br />
And then, too, doubt immense and wild affright.<br />
And madness, with its eyes of marble white,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">These all are here.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
His head a prey to the dull knell's sound,<br />
In terror the grave-digger turns the ground<br />
With strokes of the spade, and doth ceaseless cast<br />
The dried-up earth upon his past.<br />
<br />
<br />
The slain days, and the present, he doth see,<br />
Quelling each quivering thrill of life to be.<br />
And drop by drop, through fists whose fingers start.<br />
Pressing the future blood of his red heart;<br />
Chewing with teeth that grind and crush, each part<br />
Of that his future's body, limb by limb,<br />
Till there is but a carcase left to him;<br />
And shewing him, in coffins prisoned,<br />
Or ever they be born, his longings dead.<br />
<br />
<br />
The grave-digger yonder doth hear the knell,<br />
More heavy yet, of the passing bell.<br />
That up through the mourning horizons doth swell<br />
What if the bells, with their haunting swing,<br />
Would stop on a day that heart-breaking ring!<br />
And the endless procession of corse after corse.<br />
Choke the highways no more of his long remorse<br />
But the biers, with the prayers and the tears,<br />
Immensely yet follow the biers;<br />
They halt by crucifix now, and by shrine,<br />
Then take up once more their mournful line;<br />
On the backs of men, upon trestles borne.<br />
They follow their uniform march forlorn;<br />
Skirting each field and each garden-wall.<br />
Passing beneath the sign-posts tall,<br />
Skirting along by the vast Unknown,<br />
Where terror points horns from the corner-stone.<br />
<br />
<br />
The old man, broken and propless quite.<br />
Watches them still from the infinite<br />
Coming towards him&mdash;and hath beside<br />
Nothing to do, but in earth to hide<br />
His multiple death, thus bit by bit,<br />
And, with fingers irresolute, plant on it<br />
Crosses so hastily, day by day,<br />
Since what long times&mdash;he cannot say.<br />

Here comes the wind,<br />
The wind with his trumpet that Heralds November;<br />
Endless and infinite, crossing the downs,<br />
Here comes the wind<br />
That teareth himself and doth fiercely dismember;<br />
Which heavy breaths turbulent smiting the towns,<br />
The savage wind comes, the fierce wind of November!<br />
<br />
<br />
Each bucket of iron at the wells of the farmyards,<br />
Each bucket and pulley, it creaks and it wails;<br />
By cisterns of farmyards, the pulleys and pails<br />
They creak and they cry,<br />
The whole of sad death in their melancholy.<br />
<br />
<br />
The wind, it sends scudding dead leaves from the birches<br />
Along o'er the water, the wind of November,<br />
The savage, fierce wind;<br />
The boughs of the trees for the birds' nests it searches,<br />
To bite them and grind.<br />
The wind, as though rasping down iron, grates past,<br />
And, furious and fast, from afar combs the cold<br />
And white avalanches of winter the old.<br />
The savage wind combs them so furious and fast.<br />
The wind of November.<br />
<br />
<br />
From each miserable shed<br />
The patched garret-windows wave wild overhead<br />
Their foolish, poor tatters of paper and glass.<br />
As the savage, fierce wind of November doth pass!<br />
And there on its hill<br />
Of dingy and dun-coloured turf, the black mill,<br />
Swift up from below, through the empty air slashing,<br />
Swift down from above, like a lightning-stroke flashing,<br />
The black mill so sinister moweth the wind.<br />
The savage, fierce wind of November!<br />
<br />
<br />
The old, ragged thatches that squat round their steeple,<br />
Are raised on their roof-poles, and fall with a clap,<br />
In the wind the old thatches and pent-houses flap,<br />
In the wind of November, so savage and hard.<br />
The crosses&mdash;and they are the arms of dead people&mdash;<br />
The crosses that stand in the narrow churchyard<br />
Fall prone on the sod<br />
Like some great flight of black, in the acre of God.<br />
<br />
<br />
The wind of November!<br />
Have you met him, the savage wind, do you remember?<br />
Did he pass you so fleet,<br />
&mdash;Where, yon at the cross, the three hundred roads meet&mdash;<br />
With distressfulness panting, and wailing with cold?<br />
Yea, he who breeds fears and puts all things to flight,<br />
Did you see him, that night<br />
When the moon he o'erthrew&mdash;when the villages, old<br />
In their rot and decay, past endurance and spent,<br />
Cried, wailing like beasts, 'neath the hurricane bent?<br />
<br />
<br />
Here comes the wind howling, that heralds dark weather,<br />
The wind blowing infinite over the heather.<br />
The wind with his trumpet that heralds November!<br />

Thickening into rolls more dank,<br />
The thresholds and the window-sills,<br />
And smokes on every bank.<br />

The river stagnates, pestilent<br />
With carrion by the current sent<br />
This way and that&mdash;and yonder lies<br />
The moon, just like a woman dead,<br />
That they have smothered overhead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Deep in the skies.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
In a few boats alone there gleam<br />
Lamps that light up and magnify<br />
The backs, bent over stubbornly,<br />
Of the old fishers of the stream,<br />
Who since last evening, steadily,<br />
&mdash;For God knows what night-fishery&mdash;<br />
Have let their black nets downward slow<br />
Into the silent water go.<br />
The noisome water there below.<br />
<br />
<br />
Down in the river's deeps, ill-fate<br />
And black mischances breed and hatch.<br />
Unseen of them, and lie in wait<br />
As for their prey. And these they catch<br />
With weary toil&mdash;believing still<br />
That simple, honest work is best&mdash;<br />
At night, beneath the shifting mist<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Unkind and chill.</span><br />

So hard and harsh, yon clock-towers tell.<br />
With muffled hammers, like a knell,<br />
The midnight hour.<br />
From tower to tower<br />
So hard and harsh the midnights chime.<br />
The midnights harsh of autumn time,<br />
The weary midnights' bell.<br />

<br />
The crew<br />
Of fishers black have on their back<br />
Nought save a nameless rag or two;<br />
And their old hats distil withal,<br />
And drop by drop let crumbling fall<br />
Into their necks, the mist-flakes all.<br />
<br />
<br />
The hamlets and their wretched huts<br />
Are numb and drowsy, and all round<br />
The willows too, and walnut trees,<br />
'Gainst which the Easterly fierce breeze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Has waged its feud.</span><br />
No bayings from the forest sound,<br />
No cry the empty midnight cuts&mdash;<br />
The midnight space that grows imbrued<br />
With damp breaths from the ashy ground.<br />

<br />
The fishers hail each other not&mdash;<br />
Nor help&mdash;in their fraternal lot;<br />
Doing but that which must be done.<br />
Each fishes for himself alone.<br />

And this one gathers in his net,<br />

His freight of petty misery;<br />

Diseases from their slimy bed;<br />
While others still their meshes spread<br />
Out to the sorrows that drift by<br />

The wreckage dark of his remorse.<br />

Goes hence&mdash;since what times out of mind?&mdash;<br />
Toward the far horizon wending<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Of weariness unending.</span><br />
Upon the banks, the skins of wet<br />
Black ooze-heaps nightly poison sweat.<br />
And the mists are their fleeces light<br />
That curl up to the houses' height.<br />
<br />
<br />
In their dark boats, where nothing stirs,<br />
Not even the red-flamed torch that blurs<br />
With halos huge, as if of blood.<br />
The thick felt of the mist's white hood,<br />
Death with his silence seals the sere<br />
Old fishermen of madness here.<br />
<br />
<br />
The isolated, they abide<br />
Deep in the mist&mdash;still side by side.<br />
But seeing one another never;<br />
Weary are both their arms&mdash;and yet<br />
Their work their ruin doth beget.<br />
<br />
<br />
Each for himself works desperately,<br />
He knows not why&mdash;no dreams has he;<br />
Long have they worked, for long, long years,<br />
While every instant brings its fears;<br />
Nor have they ever<br />
Quitted the borders of their river,<br />
Where 'mid the moonlit mists they strain<br />
To fish misfortune up amain.<br />
<br />
<br />
If but in this their night they hailed each other<br />
And brothers' voices might console a brother!<br />
<br />
<br />
But numb and sullen, on they go,<br />
With heavy brows and backs bent low,<br />
While their small lights beside them gleam,<br />
Flickering feebly on the stream.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like blocks of shadow they are there.<br />
Nor ever do their eyes divine<br />
That far away beyond the mists<br />
Acrid and spongy&mdash;there exists<br />
A firmament where 'mid the night.<br />
Attractive as a loadstone, bright<br />
Prodigious planets shine.<br />

The fishers black of that black plague,<br />
They are the lost immeasurably,<br />
Among the knells, the distance vague,<br />
The yonder of those endless plains<br />
That stretch more far than eye can see:<br />
And the damp autumn midnight rains<br />
Into their souls' monotony.<br />

And the white flame of countless diamonds burns.<br />
Like myriads of silent eyes intent,<br />

Let us our glances lave, and make them clear,<br />
Of all the thousand glances that they here<br />
Have met, in this base world of servile lies.<br />

<br />
The dawn is dressed in blossom and in dew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And chequered too</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">With very tender light&mdash;it looks as though</span><br />
Frail plumes of sun and silver, through the mist,<br />
Glided across the garden to and fro,<br />
And with a soft caress the mosses kissed.<br />

<br />
Our wondrous ponds of blue<br />
Tremble and wake with golden shimmerings;<br />
Swift emerald flights beneath the trees dart through.<br />
And now the light from hedge and path anew<br />
Sweeps the damp dust, where yet the twilight clings.<br />

In hours like these, when through our dream of bliss<br />
So far from all things not ourselves we move,<br />
What lustral blood, what baptism is this<br />
That bathes our hearts, straining toward perfect love?<br />
<br />
<br />
Our hands are clasped, and yet there is no prayer,<br />
Our arms outstretched, and yet no cry is there;<br />
Adoring something, what, we cannot say.<br />
More pure than we are and more far away,<br />
With spirit fervent and most guileless grown,<br />
How we are mingled and dissolved in one;<br />
Ah, how we live each other, in the unknown!<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, how absorbed and wholly lost before<br />
The presence of those hours supreme one lies!<br />
And how the soul would fain find other skies<br />
To seek therein new gods it might adore;<br />
Oh, marvellous and agonizing joy,<br />
Audacious hope whereon the spirit hangs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Of being one day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Once more the prey,</span><br />

Opening the mists on a sudden through,<br />
An Avenue!<br />
Then, all one ferment of varied gold,<br />
With foam of plumes where the chamfrom bends<br />
Round his horse's head, that no bit doth hold,<br />
St. George descends!<br />
<br />
<br />
The diamond-rayed caparison,<br />
Makes of his flight one declining path<br />
From Heaven's pity down upon<br />
Our waiting earth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hero and Lord<br />
Of the joyous, helpful virtues all.<br />
Sonorous, pure and crystalline!<br />
Let his radiance fall<br />
On my heart nocturnal and make it shine<br />
In the wheeling aureole of his sword!<br />
<br />
<br />
Let the wind's soft silvern whispers sound<br />
And ring his coat of mail around,<br />
His battle-spurs amid the fight!<br />
&mdash;He&mdash;the St. George&mdash;who shines so bright<br />
And comes, 'mid the wailings of my desire.<br />
To seize and lift my poor hands higher<br />
Toward his dauntless valour's fire!<br />
<br />
<br />
Like a cry great with faith, to God<br />
His lance St. George upraised doth hold;<br />
Crossing athwart my glance he trod.<br />
As 'twere one tumult of haggard gold.<br />
The chrism's glow on his forehead shone,<br />
The great St. George of duty high!<br />
Beautiful by his heart, and by<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Himself alone!</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Ring, all my voices of hope, ring on!<br />
Ring forth in me<br />
Beneath fresh boughs of greenery,<br />
Down radiant pathways, full of sun;<br />
Ye glints of silvery mica, be<br />
Bright joy amid my stones&mdash;and ye<br />
White pebbles that the waters strew.<br />
Open your eyes in my brooklets, through<br />
The watery lids that cover you;<br />
Landscape of gushing springs and sun,<br />
With gold that quivers on misty blue,<br />
Landscape that dwells in me, hold thou<br />
The mirror now<br />
To the fiery flights, that flaming roll,<br />
Of the great St. George toward my soul!<br />
<br />
<br />
'Gainst the black Dragon's teeth and claws,<br />
Against the armour of leprous sores,<br />
The miracle and sword is he;<br />
On his breast-plate burneth Charity,<br />
And his gentleness sends hurtling back.<br />
In dire defeat, the Instinct black.<br />
Fires flecked with gold, that flashing turn,<br />
Whirlwinds of stars, those glories meet,<br />
About his galloping horse's feet.<br />
Deep into my remembrance burn<br />
Their lightnings fleet!<br />
<br />
<br />
He comes, a fair ambassador,<br />
From white lands built with marble o'er.<br />
Where grows, in glades beside the sea,<br />
Upon the tree<br />
Of goodness, fragrant gentleness.<br />
That haven, too, he knows no less<br />
Where wondrous ships rock, calm and still.<br />
That freights of sleeping angels fill;<br />
And those vast evenings, when below<br />
Upon the water, 'mid the skies'<br />
Reflected eyes.<br />
Islands flash sudden forth and glow.<br />
That kingdom fair<br />
Whereof the Virgin ariseth Queen,<br />
Its lowly, ardent joy is he;<br />
And his flaming sword in the ambient air<br />
Vibrates like an ostensory&mdash;<br />
The suddenly flashing St. George! behold,<br />
He strikes through my soul like a fire of gold!<br />
<br />
<br />
He knows from what far wanderings<br />
I come: what mists obscure my brain;<br />
What dagger marks have deeply scarred<br />
My thought, and with black crosses marred:<br />
With what spent force, what anger vain.<br />
What petty scorn of better things,<br />
&mdash;Yea, and with what a mask I came,<br />
Folly upon the lees of shame!<br />
A coward was I; the world I fled<br />
To hide my head<br />
Within a huge and futile Me;<br />
I builded, beneath domes of Night,<br />
The blocks of marble, gold be-starred,<br />
Of a hostile science, endlessly<br />
Towards a height<br />
By oracles of blackness barred.<br />
For Death alone is Queen of night.<br />
And human effort is brightest born<br />
Only at dawn.<br />
With opening flowers would prayer fain bloom,<br />
And their sweet lips hold the same perfume.<br />
The sunbeams shimmering white that fall<br />
On pearly water, are for all<br />
Like a caress<br />
Upon our life: the dawn unfolds<br />
A counsel fair of trustfulness;<br />
And whoso hearkens thereto is saved<br />
From his slough, where never a sin was laved.<br />
<br />
<br />
St. George in radiant armour came<br />
Speeding along in leaps of flame<br />
'Mid the sweet morning, through my soul.<br />
Young, beautiful by faith was he;<br />
He leaned the lower down toward me<br />
Even as I the lowlier knelt;<br />
Like some pure, golden cordial<br />
In secret felt.<br />
He filled me with his soaring strength,<br />
And with sweet fear most tenderly.<br />
Before that vision's dignity,<br />
Into his pale, proud hand at length<br />
I cast the blood my pain had spent.<br />
Then, laying upon me as he went<br />
A charge of valour, and the sign<br />
Of the cross on my brow from his lance divine,<br />
He sped upon his shining road<br />
Straight, with my heart, towards his God.<br />

The landscape now reveals a change;<br />
A stair&mdash;that twinèd elm-boughs hold<br />
Enclosed 'mid hedges mystic, strange&mdash;<br />
Inaugurates a green and gold<br />
Vision of gardens, range on range.<br />
<br />
<br />
Each step's a hope, that doth ascend<br />
Stairwise to expectation's height;<br />
A weary way it is to wend<br />
While noonday suns are burning bright.<br />
But rest waits at the evening's end.<br />
<br />
<br />
Streams, that wash white from sin, flow deep,<br />
And round about the fresh lawns twine;<br />
While there, beneath the green banks steep,<br />
Beside his cross, the Lamb Divine<br />
Lies tranquilly in peaceful sleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
The daisied grass is glad, and gay<br />
With crystal butterflies the hedge.<br />
Where globes of fruit shine blue; here stray<br />
Peacocks beside the box-trees' edge:<br />
A shining lion bars the way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Flowers, upright as the ecstasies<br />
And ardours of white spirits pure,<br />
With branches springing fountain-wise,<br />
Burst upward, and by impulse sure<br />
To their own soaring splendour rise.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gently and very slowly swayed.<br />
The wind a wordless rhapsody<br />
Sings&mdash;and the shimm'ring air doth braid<br />
An aureole of filigree<br />
Round every disk with emerald laid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even the shade is but a flight<br />
Toward flickering radiances, that slip<br />
From space to space; and now the light<br />
Sleeps, with calmed rays, upon the lip<br />
Of lilac-blossoms golden-white.<br />

In such a spot, with radiant flowers for halo,<br />
I saw the Guardian Angel sit her down;<br />
Vine-branches fashioned a green shrine above her<br />
And sun-flowers rose behind her like a crown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Her fingers, their white slenderness encircled<br />
With humble, fragile rings of coral round.<br />
Held, ranged in couples, sprays of faithful roses.<br />
Sealed with a clasp, with threads of woollen bound.<br />
<br />
<br />
A shimmering air the golden calm was weaving,<br />
All filigree'd with dawn, that like a braid<br />
Surmounted her pure brow, which still was hidden<br />
Half in the shade.<br />
<br />
<br />
Woven of linen were her veil and sandals.<br />
But, twined 'mid boughs of foliage, on their hem<br />
The theologic Virtues Three were painted;<br />
Hearts set about with gold encompassed them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Her silken hair, slow rippling, from her shoulder<br />
Down to the mosses of the sward did reach;<br />
The childhood of her eyes disclosed a silence<br />
More sweet than speech.<br />
<br />
<br />
My arms outstretched, and all my soul upstraining.<br />
Then did I rise,<br />
With haggard yearning, toward the soul suspended<br />
There in her eyes.<br />
Those eyes, they shone so vivid with remembrance,<br />
That they confessed days lived alike with me:<br />
Oh, in the grave inviolate can it change, then,<br />
The Long Ago, and live in the To Be?<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, she was one who, being dead, yet brought me.<br />
Miraculous, a strength that comforteth,<br />
And the Viaticum of her survival<br />
Guiding me from the further side of Death.<br />
